```javascript
//This is a React component that uses the useReducer hook to manage state.
function MyComponent() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  //In this case, the reducer function is responsible for updating the state based on the action it receives.  
  const reducer = (state, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'INCREMENT':
        return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
      case 'DECREMENT':
        return { ...state, count: state.count - 1 };
      default:
        throw new Error();
    }
  };

  // This line may cause the error: 'Each child in a list should have a unique key prop.'
